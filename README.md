# HR_Management_System

**My first desktop application built in Java for a human resource management system.**

*Things you can do in the application*

1- Check all the staff/professors.

2- Add new staff, professor or a department to the system.

3- View all the employees, payrolls per department.



in other words, you manage the system as an administrator.

To begin, install the application vvv

[https://github.com/Candl3-ca/HR_System/releases/tag/alpha_v1.0.0](url)

-> Then you can add all the departments, then all employees in the department.


I'm making this completely open source, feel free to fork and create your own version!




**For future updates**
